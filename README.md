Contrubution 

** I mainly worken on implementin the optimal method using MaxHeap Interface
**Inside the MaxHeap.java I implemente the following methods
1. public MaxHeap(T[] entries) that is implementing the optimal method
2. I also added the public void add(T newEntry) that work for the sequential insertion
3. public T removeMax()
4. public void reheap(int rootIndex)
5. I also adde the methos to check capacity, integrity, and ensure capatity. 
6. finally I added some methods that helped me with the test file
7. On the test file I read the file provided "Data Sorted", run the program, and write the Outpout2. file
